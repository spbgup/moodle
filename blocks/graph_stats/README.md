Graph Statisics Block for Moodle 2.7+
===========

The graph stats block was originally developed by Ã‰ric Bugnet (https://github.com/ebugnet/graph_stats) and his repo works correctly on Moodle 2.0 - 2.4 with help from Jean Fruitet.

In Moodle 2.5+ you start to see issues with the block and this is why Wesley Ellis updated the code to work on Moodle 2.5, 2.6+ and also added some new features.

In Moodle 2.7+ block stopped working after changes in Moodle logging procedures. Vadim Dvorovenko has changed code to use Standart log introdueced in Moodle 2.7
